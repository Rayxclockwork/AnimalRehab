## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Our application will help support the many volunteers that spend their extra time and resources caring for sick or injured wildlife. Without the in-depth training vets receive, these volunteers need resources so there's no guess-and-check in giving animals medication the could result in the animals getting worse, rather than better. Our idea was to make this website a resource with a list of medications that are safe to use and a way to calculate the correct dosage. 

## Getting Started

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
- Basic tools: Python, VS code, Github, Command line

- Our application was built with a Django backend and a React front end. We have a postgresql database and several react components to render our pages. 

- We deployed the backend to DigitalOcean, and the front end to Now.

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
